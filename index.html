      <p>
Coldplay are a British rock band formed in 1996 by lead singer and pianist Chris Martin and lead guitarist Jonny Buckland at University College London (UCL).[1] After they formed under the name Pectoralz, Guy Berryman joined the group as bassist and they changed their name to Starfish.[2] Will Champion joined as drummer and backing vocalist, completing the lineup. Creative director and former manager Phil Harvey is often referred to as the fifth member by the band.[3] The band renamed themselves "Coldplay" in 1998,[3] before recording and releasing three EPs: Safety in 1998 and Brothers & Sisters and The Blue Room in 1999. The Blue Room was their first release on a major label, after signing to Parlophone.[4]
